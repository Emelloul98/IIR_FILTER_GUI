# Filter Diagram Generator

This repository contains a Python script that generates visual diagrams for Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter structures using the `matplotlib` library. The script takes user-defined coefficients for the filters and produces graphical representations of their structures.

## Features

- Generates clear and illustrative diagrams of FIR and IIR filter structures.
- Customizable coefficients for both filters.
- Utilizes the `matplotlib` library for graphical visualization.
